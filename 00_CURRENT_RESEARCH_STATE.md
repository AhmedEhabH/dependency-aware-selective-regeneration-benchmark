**Single authoritative current-state document — POST-ICCI closure (2026-09-15).**
**This document SUPERSEDES the historical handoffs (it does NOT delete them).**
For historical closure records see `docs/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`, `SYSTEM_STATE.md`,

## 3. Exact tags / SHAs (authoritative)

- `v0.11.0-benchmark-complete` — benchmark closed + audited (NOT end-to-end
  executor success).
- `v0.11.1-p1-serialization-docs-model-refactor`, `v0.11.2-p5-locagent-shared-comparison`,
  `v0.11.3-p5-reporting-corrections` @ `884ba79…`.
- Study tags: `real-commit-p1-full-v2-vs-sparse-v2-01-audited`,
  `real-commit-impact-dataset-v1-corpus-audited`,
  `real-commit-impact-dataset-v1-m4a1-closure-audited`,
  `graph-c0-c1-c2-01-study-01-audited`,
  `controlled-encoding-ablation-16k-study-01-audited`, etc.
- P1 frozen protocol `real-commit-p1-v1.0.0`; P1 model `qwen/qwen3-coder`
  (Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct) @ `deepinfra/turbo`; temp 0; cap 16384; Graph OFF.
- LocAgent pinned upstream commit `4935b557326c154bad8e8dcf3747cc8d32d1f387`.

## 4. Datasets / splits (frozen, ZERO-API)

- `benchmark_data/real_commit_impact_v1/`: **40 scientific djangoCMS cases** +
  6 MINER_DEV cases.
- Split freeze (seed `20260913`, metadata-only, pre-model): **TRAIN 24 /
  VALIDATION 6 / HELD_OUT_TEST 10** (`split_freeze.json`,
  `scientific_manifest.json`).
- Gold = **OBSERVED CHANGE-SET PROXY** (evaluation-only), never semantic
  ground truth.

## 5. Exposed test sets — PERMANENT (do not tune)

- **The 10 HELD_OUT_TEST tasks are PERMANENTLY EXPOSED** (P1 M4A-3/P1 ran
  Full-v2 and Sparse-v2 with 3 nested reps; P5-C ran LocAgent 10/10). They are
  used for reporting/audit only.
- **DO NOT TUNE any new method on these 10 tasks.** Any tuned-threshold /
  selected-feature / escalation-policy decision must be made on
  TRAIN/VALIDATION (or MINER_DEV) and confirmed on a FRESH held-out split
  that has never been used for any selection decision.
- **DO NOT CALL-CONFIRMATORY on the exposed 10** to "check" a new method:
  repeated confirmatory inference on the same exposed split is confirmatory
  bias. Fresh confirmatory protocol = new repository OR new non-exposed split.

## 6. Current threats (active, from `reports/M1_THREATS_TO_VALIDITY_MATRIX.md`)

1. HELD_OUT_TEST exposure (now permanent — mitigation: fresh split required).
2. Survivor-conditioned LocAgent metrics must never be reported as headline.
3. Change-set proxy is an observed diff, not semantic ground truth.
4. Single-repository, single-model selection evidence (djangoCMS;
   Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct).
5. LocAgent provider route is OpenRouter-routed (backend not pinned per call);
   cost $9.9288 is a NORMALIZED estimate, not provider-billed.
6. No arm-superiority claim from P1: paired ΔF1 CIs cross zero.
7. Selective escalation is NOT validated — proposal only.

## 7. Current numbers (frozen, recomputed 2026-09-15, ZERO API)

### P1 (10 tasks × 2 arms × 3 reps = 60 cells; 60/60 valid; 566,755 tokens; $0.36)
- Full-v2 micro: P 0.3388 / R 0.3694 / F1 0.3534 / FNR 0.6306.
- Sparse-v2 micro: P 0.3867 / R 0.2613 / F1 0.3118 / FNR 0.7387.
- Paired bootstrap over 10 tasks: ΔF1 −0.0088 [−0.1297, +0.1189] (crosses zero);
  Δcost −$0.0235 [−0.0244, −0.0228] (cost effect supported, descriptive).

### P5 LocAgent (10 tasks × 1 exec; 402 calls; 32.8M tokens; $9.9288 est.)
- **Headline (A, fail-closed all-10):** TP 10 / FP 13 / FN 27 → P 0.4348 /
  R 0.2703 / F1 0.3333 / FNR 0.7297.
- **Diagnostic (B, usable-5, survivor-conditioned — NOT headline):** micro
  P 0.4348 / R 0.4000 / F1 0.4167 / FNR 0.6000; macro P 0.6909 / R 0.6033 /
  F1 0.6370 / FNR 0.3967.
- Failure taxonomy: **2 timeout / 1 context-length BadRequest / 2
  completed-but-empty** (NOT "5 timeouts").
- Official native Acc@K: Acc@1 4/10, Acc@3 4/10, Acc@5 2/10 (the old 8/10,
  9/10 were item-hit sums — corrected).
- Source: `research/locagent-p5b/locagent_two_way.json` +
  `reports/LOCAGENT_P5C_SHARED_COMPARISON.md`.

### Four-action FN breakdown (existing P1 raw outputs; secondary diagnostic)
- Full-v2 FN 70: PRESERVE 70 / VALIDATE 0 / HUMAN_REVIEW 0.
- Sparse-v2 FN 82: PRESERVE 74 / VALIDATE 8 / HUMAN_REVIEW 0.
- Both arms: PRESERVE 144 / VALIDATE 8 / HUMAN_REVIEW 0 (REGENERATE excluded
  by construction). See
  `research/post-icci-zero-api-closure/four_action_fn_breakdown.{json,csv}`.

## 8. Next experiment — ONLY ONE (not started, not authorized without review)

**Selective escalation for cost-aware repository change localization** (the
proposal topic), evaluated on TRAIN/VALIDATION (non-LLM cheap baselines first),
then a FRESH confirmatory split. Drafted protocols (NOT executed):
`docs/POST_ICCI_NEXT_EXPERIMENTS_DRAFT.md`.

Sequence per the MSc roadmap:
`Sparse first pass → omission-risk detection → selective graph-guided escalation
→ bounded false-negative verification`.

## 9. DO-NOT warnings (operational)

- **DO-NOT-TUNE** on the exposed HELD_OUT_TEST ten.
- **DO-NOT-CALL-CONFIRMATORY** on the exposed ten.
- **DO-NOT** claim selective escalation has been validated.
- **DO-NOT** run Saleor / LocBench / new LocAgent inference / new model
  matrices without a fresh preregistration + frozen budget.
- **DO-NOT** alter frozen P1/P5 outputs; all post-ICCI analyses are
  read-only recomputations from existing evidence.
